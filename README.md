# udacity_dl_dcgan-svhn
Assignment-level repo for 'dcgan-svhn' from Udacity's Deep Learning nanodegree course

The DCGAN_Exercises notebook can be rendered on GitHub, but it may take a couple of page refreshes, because the notebook is quite large.
It will usually render in 1-3 tries. It's one of the best projects, so check it out!
